# Page View Time Series Visualizer

I edited the time_series_visualizer.py boilerplate file from freeCodeCamp to solve the project on Page View Time Series Visualiser.
Project involves visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots.
I used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. 
The data visualizations will help me understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.
Project also involves reading the test_module.py to see what exactly is the project is asking for with regards to the plots
